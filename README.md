# Bellabeat_Case_Study

## Background
Bellabeat, a hightech manufacturer of smart health-focused products for women, was founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur. This technology design was designed by Sršen's background as an artist. 

Bellabeat had devolved a worldwide presence by 2016, and although focusining on digital marketing, has also invested in many traditional avenues of advertisting; radio, billboards, print, and television.

To get to the next level, Sršen knows the importance of utilising available consumer data; asking the marketing analytics team to analyse usage data of their products. High-level recommendations are hoped to come from this, which can shape Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
